Hi Jesse,

 

Please see the assignment instructions below. You will have a maximum of 2 hours to respond with the required deliverables (ie. Please send me your completed assessment by 5pm).

 

Target: 2 hours

 

The company you work for is starting a new project called “Absolute API web service”. The web service will be deployed to an on premise Kubernetes cluster. You have been assigned to design the build and deployment framework using Ansible, Docker, Helm, and Jenkins. You decide to write Ansbile playbooks to build a simple environment using Docker and Minikube to demonstrate the framework to your team members.

 

You only have 2 hours so the goal is to show how you think the framework should be built and how to use Ansible to setup and configure the server, Jenkins, etc. Don't get too stuck on the detail configurations or helm package. If you are not familiar with Kubernetes and/or helm, please focus on Ansible, Docker, and Jenkins.

 

Deliverables:

1.    A design documentation to describe the framework.

2.    Ansible playbooks and Dockerfile/docker-compose file.

3.    A GitHub or GitLab repository with your work. Please commit often so we can see the history as you develop the solution.
